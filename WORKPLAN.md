Malik: Complete Levels 1 and 2, with thorough testing to ensure functionality and stability.


Week 2:

Malik: Work on and complete Levels 3 and 4, including proper testing for each level.

Week 3:

Malik: If additional time is needed, finalize Levels 3 and 4 with comprehensive testing. Begin working on extra credit if time permits.

Week 4:
Team: Practice presentations to ensure clarity and flow for project demonstration.

Malik: Begin module integration with other team members. Continue extra credit work if there is time.


Week 5:
